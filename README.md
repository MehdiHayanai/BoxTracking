# PA10 Computer Vision Project - Arts et Métiers ParisTech

## Description
This project involves video processing using computer vision techniques. It includes frame analysis, optical flow tracking, and pose estimation to analyze video frames. The code also draws lines and points on the frames, providing visualized insights into the video content. This project is a part of the PA10 projects within the Arts et Métiers ParisTech training.

## Installation
Ensure you have the required dependencies, including OpenCV (cv2) and NumPy.

## Usage
1. Place your video file in the specified directory or update the `video_path` variable in the code.
2. Run the code to analyze the video frames and visualize the processed frames.

## Features
- Optical flow analysis between consecutive video frames.
- Pose estimation and projection of known object points onto frames.
- Drawing lines and points on video frames for visualization.
